About Breathing Art Installation:

I believe design for pleasure is subtle but still useful. My design philosophy is to capture the poetic and pleasure moment for viewers. In my project, I have created a space for viewers with several dandelion lamps, immersing themselves in the calming restful place. To demonstrate blowing the seeds off a dandelion, I use several Arduino Uno and sound sensors to control each one. And then light up when someone blows on them. The Arduino is put under the bottle and the complicated wires and battery are all inside of the bottle.
